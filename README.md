# The SGXP: The Open Source Sprite Website

## Introduction
The SGXP has evolved quite a bit since I first started the project in the summer of 2019. From a small webpage hardcoded in HTML with a small bit of CSS, to a fully functional site based in PHP, this site has grown at the same speed as my knowledge in web development. Along the way we have also amassed a small community of members pasionate about the medium of spriting; and though we started as an MFZ clone, we have managed to spread our wings and become something all on our own.

This repo is a project to transition the current website to fit new technologies. We are currently (as of 12/13/2023) working with Astro as our front-end Strapi as our CMS on the back-end. The end goal is to have a fully functional website where users can upload sprite sheets, sprite comics, and showcase their WIP art.

## Getting Started

If you would like to work on this repository, there a just a few things you will need to know:

1. You will need to make sure Node and NPM are installed on your machine
2. Once you have cloned the repository open your terminal in VS Code and type `npm run build` to have astro compile the project. Then once that's finished, type `npm run start` to start up Astro's localhost server to view the site.
